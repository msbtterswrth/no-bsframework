<h1>No BS Framework</h1>
        <p>This is a project which aims to recreate a simplified version of bootstrap's grid with scss without actually including bootstrap and needing to overwrite a million bootstrap things.</p>
        <p>The base markup and class structure will basically remain the same from standard bootstrap; ie: the use of 'container', 'row' and various 'col-' classes.</p>
          <p>The major differnce here is both base 10 as well as the standard base 12 grid classes are included. Grid classes are based on percentage of 100 - so col-sm-33 is 33% of the container width, col-sm-83 is 83% of the container width and so on. This allows for more complexity and flexibilty in your designs and builds.</p>
